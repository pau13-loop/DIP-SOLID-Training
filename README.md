# DIP Java Exercise

> In this repository you'll find **DIP Principle Java Exercise**. This kata is to understand the DIP Principle that belongs to the SOLID Principles that you should follow to make your code cleaner and precisely. In case you don't know about how works this principle or how to apply it correctly below you'll find a link that will explain it and it has some examples where you can get an idea about how to work with this principle precisely and correctly.

## Motivation

The motivation I've found to make this exercise, it's improved my skills working with the SOLID Principles. I know they're really useful like for example being able to improve and reduce considerably the dependencies of your program, always you should try to have a program with great cohesion and low coupling. If you follow these principles correctly, you can get this goal.

## Reflections

My reflection about this exercise is that at the beginning I was not to sure about what to do, but this is because my information about the DIP Principle was not to extense, for example the link I left above on the introduction it made me the things a lot easier and when I completely understood how to work with the inversion Dependency Principle after a bit of research. I start to know how important the interfaces are for every program and how can make your work a lot easier, this kata just has helped me to have an idea when I should work with them. I remember the main concepts, but I have to train a lot more myself to get fluent with the DIP Principle.
